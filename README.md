Hey there! My name is Noah, I'm a versatile web developer passionate about creating online experiences.

My stack:

- HTML (Including JSX)
- CSS (Including SASS and Tailwind)
- JavaScript (Including Typescript)
- React (Including React Native)
- Node.js
- CMS Development (Wix, WordPress)
- Git
- Adobe Suite (Photoshop, Premiere)
  I'm also currently learning:
  MongoDB, Express, Php, and C# (I'm a game developer!)

I'll keep the skill list short, and instead show you some of the cool projects I've worked on.
I love taking a problem I've found and engineering a solution for it from the ground up. Some of my case studies include:

[Sky Height Tool](https://skyheight.net) is a tool that allows players of the popular online game "Sky: Children of the Light" to calculate the height of their character in-game. I built this tool because height is a pretty vague concept in the game, and I wanted to give players a way to measure it accurately. It has hundreds of users daily and has been featured in the official Wiki of the game, and also has an active discord community where players can discuss the tool and suggest new features.

[Aelar Fourcrest Card](https://www.fourcrest.xyz) is my attempt at taking a widely-used static landing page creator (Carrd, typically used for custom character information) and providing more personal, fully customizable, and cheaper alternatives. I believe that everyone should be able to express themselves and their works without needing a tacky subscription for basic features. It's a work in progress, but it's already being used by a few people and has been well-received.

[My Portfolio](https://noahbazer.dev) is my personal portfolio, where I showcase my skills and projects. I built it from scratch using only vanilla languages, and it's been a great way to show off my work to potential clients and employers, as well as develop a firmer understanding of base technologies without all of the bells and whistles.
